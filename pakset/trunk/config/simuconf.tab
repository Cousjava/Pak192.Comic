################################ Vehicle settings ##############################

# These settings determine how vehicles take corners, for each individual type of way.  They
# only apply to vehicles that use fixed ways (road, rail, monorail, etc.), and not aircraft or
# ships. Note that these settings have changed substantially from versions earlier than 11.
# 
# corner_force_divider_[way type]: The maximum force as a proportion of G (gravitational force)
# that it is permissible for vehicles of this way type to experience when taking a corner. This
# number is expressed as a divider: e.g., a value of 10 is 1/10th of G, or 0.1G. The higher this
# number, the slower that vehicles have to travel in corners. 
#
# The explanation for this formula can be found here:
# https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NbYqQSQcE2MC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=curve+radius+speed+limit+formula+rail&source=bl&ots=mbfC3lCnX4&sig=qClyuNSarnvL-zgOj4HlTVgYOr8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sBGwVOSGHMyBU4mHgNAC&ved=0CCYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=curve%20radius%20speed%20limit%20formula%20rail&f=false
# The value of 10 (i.e., 0.1G) is accurate for rail for modern practice in the UK. Road appears
# to work well at 5 (0.2G), but the value is an estimate. Superelevation is not accounted for.
# Tilting trains are defined for the individual vehicles.
#
# curve_friction_factor_[way type]: The number of times extra friction that applies as a vehicle 
# corners. 
#
# tilting_min_radius_effect: The minimum radius of a corner (in meters, calibrated according
# to the meters_per_tile setting) at which a tilting train can traverse a corner faster than
# a non-tilting train.

# These settings determine how long that it takes a road and rail vehicles to turn
# around when it reaches the end of the line. They do not apply to boats or aircraft.
#
# "road_reverse_time_seconds" refers to road vehicles.
#
# "unit_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys, such as multiple units, that have
# a cab at each and, and can be driven in reverse without any re-arrangement of 
# the order of the vehicles. These will generally take the least time to reverse.
#
# "hauled_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys that cannot be driven from the
# rear, so the locomotive at the front has to run around the train and attach
# to the rear, but where that locomotive can itself be driven in either direction,
# so that it does not need to turn around.
#
# "turntable_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys that, as for the above category,
# cannot be driven from the rear, but that also require their locomotive to be turned
# around to face the other direction (such as steam locomotives with tenders) at the
# end of the journey. These will genearlly take the most time to reverse.
#
# All times are in game seconds. In previous versions, these were specified in internal
# milliseconds by "unit_reverse_time" (etc.) without "_seconds", but these values
# had to be adjusted manually to match the meters per tile setting. The old keywords
# "(unit_reverse_time)" etc. still work, but are overridden by the "..._seconds" version
# where they are present.

# This setting allows the way in which weight limits are enforced to be customised.
# The meanings of each setting are as follows:
# 0: weight limits are ignored entirely. 
# 1: then vehicles can travel over roads, rails, tunnels and bridges for which they are too heavy, but only at greatly reduced speed. 
# 2: Vehicles cannot travel over ways for which they are overweight at all. 
# 3: Vehciles cannot travel over ways for which they are more than 10% overweight at all, and will travel on ways for which they are up to 10% overweight at a greatly reduced speed.

# Corners of greater than 45 degrees have their radius calculated. However, because of 
# the rigid tile system in Simutrans, this produces unrealistic results when applied
# to corners of 45 degrees. A value is thus specified here. This affects the speed
# at which vehicles can take pairs of directionally correcting 45 degree corners
# (i.e. not a pair of 45 degree corners which between them add up to 90 degrees,
# which can be calculated more easily and are dealt with by a separate system). 
#
# If this is set to 0, pairs of self-correcting 45 degree corners are treated
#  as being straight.
# 
# For any other value, this serves as a minimum assumed radius for any given pair
# of self-correcting 45 degree corners. A calculated value will be used to work
# out what the radius of the self-correcting corners should be, but, because of 
# the rigid tile system in Simutrans, it is not possible to make gentle corners,
# so set this as a minimum to allow for this.

# will walk between intermediate stops as well as from their origin to the first stop 
# on their journey.

# Note that, with the setting enabled, there is no means of preventing passengers from
# walking between two or more consecutive stops or from walking as the first or last stage
# in their journey, such that their overall walking distance is greater than the catchment
# area would be permissible for walking for the stop to or from which they are walking.
# This setting might also have the incidental effects of allowing a stop to take passengers
# from an area not covered by that stop's coverage radius, but covered by the radius of 
# another stop (possibly owned by a rival player) in the nearby vicinity, and of passengers
# walking instead of using player transport in some cases.
